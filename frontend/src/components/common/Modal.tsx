/**
 * One modal shell, replacing 22 hand-rolled ones.
 *
 * The a11y half was already solved: `lib/useDialog.ts` and `lib/useFocusTrap.ts` give the panel its
 * `role`, its `aria-modal`, its accessible name, a Tab trap and focus restored to whatever opened
 * it — and 20 files already call them. What was still copied into every file was the *chrome*: the
 * backdrop, the Escape handler, the click-outside handler, the heading, and a close `X` that in 14
 * of those files had no label at all. That is what this absorbs.
 *
 * ## Why not `<dialog>`
 *
 * The obvious implementation is the native element, and it is the wrong one here. `showModal()`
 * promotes the dialog into the top layer, and five of this app's modals contain a `Select` whose
 * listbox is a `createPortal` into `document.body` at `z-[9999]` — below the top layer, therefore
 * invisible and unreachable the moment the dialog is native (`CreatePrModal`, `ConnectGithubModal`,
 * `ConnectAdoModal`, `ExportModal`, `EnvironmentModal`). The same holds for `ColorSwatchPicker`,
 * `ChatModelPicker` and `CodeSnippetPanel`. Revisit this when those four move to the popover API;
 * until then, a positioned `div` and the existing hooks are both correct and cheaper.
