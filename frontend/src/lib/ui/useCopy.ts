/**
 * Puts text on the clipboard through the shell when there is one, and through the web API otherwise.
 *
 * **The shell first, deliberately.** `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is not a reliable floor: it
 * resolves against `clipboard-sanitized-write`, a permission this app already got wrong once —
 * every copy button in it was dead for months and reported success anyway (`BOOT-029`) — and it
 * rejects with `Document is not focused`, or fails outright while another process holds the Windows
 * clipboard or a remote session has no redirection. `clipboard.writeText` in the main process is a
 * direct OS call with none of those failure modes. The web API stays as the fallback for a plain
 * `vite dev` in a browser, where there is no bridge at all.
 *
 * **The checkmark waits for the write to actually land**, on either path. It used to be a discarded
 * promise followed by an unconditional `setCopied(true)`, which is how twelve call sites reported a
 * success that had not happened.

 * has no state to show. Under WKWebView those call sites were the broken ones —
 * `navigator.clipboard.writeText` without a live user gesture is refused outright with
 * `NotAllowedError` (measured), and a handler that awaits anything before writing has already lost
 * the gesture. Going through Go has no such rule.
