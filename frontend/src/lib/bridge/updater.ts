 * The update surface `updateStore.ts` expects, shaped like the updater surface.

 * This is the one bypass whose shape genuinely changes rather than its wiring, and the reason is
 * that neither half of 1.7.2's mechanism survives this codebase. the shell's plugin fetched a
 * minisign-signed `latest.json` from a public repository and replaced the binary itself; this
 * repository is private, so the manifest cannot be read anonymously, and the app is unsigned, so
 * there is no key to verify a replacement with.
 *
 * What is left is honest: the sidecar reads the release list with a credential the user already
 * has — the GitHub token in the OS keychain, or `gh auth token` — and hands over the artefact. No
 * token is embedded in the app and none is written next to it.
